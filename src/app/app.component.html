    These new colors are accessible via CSS variables and utility classes—like --bs-primary-bg-subtle and .bg-primary-subtle—allowing you to compose your own CSS rules with the variables, or to quickly apply styles via classes. The utilities are built with the color’s associated CSS variables, and since we customize those CSS variables for dark mode, they are also adaptive to color mode by default.
